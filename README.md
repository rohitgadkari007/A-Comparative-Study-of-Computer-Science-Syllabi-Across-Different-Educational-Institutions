This research paper compares the Computer Science syllabi from different colleges and universities. Some institutions still focus on older subjects like C and Java, while others have started including modern topics such as Python, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science. As a result, students across different colleges are not getting the same kind of learning or skill development.
We collected syllabus PDFs from various institutions and analyzed the subjects listed. The goal was to find which topics are commonly taught, which ones are unique or missing, and to identify any learning gaps. We focused on how frequently each subject appeared and created a visual dashboard to clearly present the differences between syllabi.
This research can help students, teachers, and education boards understand the need for updating and balancing the syllabus. It shows the importance of adding modern, job-relevant subjects to prepare students for todayâ€™s fast-changing tech industry. The findings of this study can be useful while designing or improving syllabi.
